Given the following scripts in\npackage.json:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    //...\n    \"scripts\": {\n        // ...\n        \"watch-js\": \"...\",\n        \"watch-css\": \"...\",\n        \"watch-node\": \"...\",\n        // ...\n    },\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n```bash\nconcurrently \"npm:watch-*\"\n\n# Equivalent to:\nconcurrently -n js,css,node \"npm run watch-js\" \"npm run watch-css\" \"npm run watch-node\"\n\n# Any name provided for the wildcard command will be used as a prefix to the wildcard\n# part of the script name:\nconcurrently -n w: npm:watch-*\n\n# Equivalent to:\nconcurrently -n w:js,w:css,w:node \"npm run watch-js\" \"npm run watch-css\" \"npm run watch-node\"\n```\n\nGood frontend one-liner example [here](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/dont-copy-paste-this-frontend-template/blob/5cd2bde719654941bdfc0a42c6f1b8e69ae79980/package.json#L9).\n\nHelp:\n\n```\n\nUsage: concurrently [options] <command ...>\n\nOptions:\n\n  -h, --help                       output usage information\n  -V, --version                    output the version number\n  -k, --kill-others                kill other processes if one exits or dies\n  --kill-others-on-fail            kill other processes if one exits with non zero status code\n  --no-color                       disable colors from logging\n  -p, --prefix <prefix>            prefix used in logging for each process.\n  Possible values: index, pid, time, command, name, none, or a template. Default: index or name (when --names is set). Example template: \"{time}-{pid}\"\n\n  -n, --names <names>              List of custom names to be used in prefix template.\n  Example names: \"main,browser,server\"\n\n  --name-separator <char>          The character to split <names> on.\n  Default: \",\". Example usage: concurrently -n \"styles,scripts|server\" --name-separator \"|\" <command ...>\n\n  -c, --prefix-colors <colors>     Comma-separated list of chalk colors to use on prefixes. If there are more commands than colors, the last color will be repeated.\n  Available modifiers: reset, bold, dim, italic, underline, inverse, hidden, strikethrough\n  Available colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, gray\n  Available background colors: bgBlack, bgRed, bgGreen, bgYellow, bgBlue, bgMagenta, bgCyan, bgWhite\n  See https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk for more information.\n  Default: \"gray.dim\". Example: \"black.bgWhite,cyan,gray.dim\"\n\n  -t, --timestamp-format <format>  specify the timestamp in moment/date-fns format. Default: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSS\n\n  -r, --raw                        output only raw output of processes, disables prettifying and concurrently coloring\n  -s, --success <first|last|all>   Return exit code of zero or one based on the success or failure of the \"first\" child to terminate, the \"last\" child, or succeed  only if \"all\" child processes succeed. Default: all\n\n  -l, --prefix-length <length>     limit how many characters of the command is displayed in prefix.\n  The option can be used to shorten long commands.\n  Works only if prefix is set to \"command\". Default: 10\n\n  --allow-restart                  Restart a process which died. Default: false\n\n  --restart-after <miliseconds>    delay time to respawn the process. Default: 0\n  \n  --restart-tries <times>          limit the number of respawn tries. Default: 1\n\n  --default-input-target <identifier> identifier for child process to which input on stdin should be sent if not specified at start of input. Can be either the index or the name of the process. Default: 0\n\nInput:\n\nInput can be sent to any of the child processes using either the name or index\nof the command followed by a colon. If no child identifier is specified then the\ninput will be sent to the child specified by the `--default-input-target`\noption, which defaults to index 0.\n\nExamples:\n\n - Kill other processes if one exits or dies\n\n     $ concurrently --kill-others \"grunt watch\" \"http-server\"\n     \n - Kill other processes if one exits with non zero status code\n\n     $ concurrently --kill-others-on-fail \"npm run build:client\" \"npm run build:server\"\n\n - Output nothing more than stdout+stderr of child processes\n\n     $ concurrently --raw \"npm run watch-less\" \"npm run watch-js\"\n\n - Normal output but without colors e.g. when logging to file\n\n     $ concurrently --no-color \"grunt watch\" \"http-server\" > log\n\n - Custom prefix\n\n     $ concurrently --prefix \"{time}-{pid}\" \"npm run watch\" \"http-server\"\n\n - Custom names and colored prefixes\n\n     $ concurrently --names \"HTTP,WATCH\" -c \"bgBlue.bold,bgMagenta.bold\" \"http-server\" \"npm run watch\"\n     \n - Shortened NPM run commands\n\n     $ concurrently npm:watch-node npm:watch-js npm:watch-css\n\n - Send input to default\n\n     $ concurrently \"nodemon\" \"npm run watch-js\"\n     rs  # Sends rs command to nodemon process\n\n - Specify a default-input-target\n\n     $ concurrently --default-input-target 1 \"npm run watch-js\" nodemon\n     rs\n\n - Send input to specific child identified by index\n\n     $ concurrently \"npm run watch-js\" nodemon\n     1:rs\n\n - Send input to specific child identified by name\n\n     $ concurrently -n js,srv \"npm run watch-js\" nodemon\n     srv:rs\n\n - Send input to default\n\n     $ concurrently \"nodemon\" \"npm run watch-js\"\n     rs  # Sends rs command to nodemon process\n\n - Specify a default-input-target\n\n     $ concurrently --default-input-target 1 \"npm run watch-js\" nodemon\n     rs\n\n - Send input to specific child identified by index\n\n     $ concurrently \"npm run watch-js\" nodemon\n     1:rs\n\n - Send input to specific child identified by name\n\n     $ concurrently -n js,srv \"npm run watch-js\" nodemon\n     srv:rs\n\n - Shortened NPM run commands\n\n     $ concurrently npm:watch-node npm:watch-js npm:watch-css\n\n - Shortened NPM run command with wildcard\n\n     $ concurrently npm:watch-*\n\nFor more details, visit https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n* Process exited with code *null*?\n\n    From [Node child_process documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_event_exit), `exit` event:\n\n    > This event is emitted after the child process ends. If the process\n    > terminated normally, code is the final exit code of the process,\n    > otherwise null. If the process terminated due to receipt of a signal,\n    > signal is the string name of the signal, otherwise null.\n\n\n    So *null* means the process didn't terminate normally. This will make **concurrent**\n    to return non-zero exit code too.\n\n\n## Why\n\nI like [task automation with npm](http://substack.net/task_automation_with_npm_run)\nbut the usual way to run multiple commands concurrently is\n`npm run watch-js & npm run watch-css`. That's fine but it's hard to keep\non track of different outputs. Also if one process fails, others still keep running\nand you won't even notice the difference.\n\nAnother option would be to just run all commands in separate terminals. I got\ntired of opening terminals and made **concurrently**.\n",
